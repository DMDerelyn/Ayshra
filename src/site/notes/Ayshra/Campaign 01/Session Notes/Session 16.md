## Other notes:

Party began speaking with Darius Corvius. Speak with him on his family, the present, and the future. He revealed some additional information about his family, and the party convinced him to part with the necessary stones to work the teleportation device as well as power them.

He discussed a few questions about the house. He mentioned that he captured and tamed a Spirit of Nature used to plant the tree in the back. He also discussed how Tieflings as honored servants. He indicated there was a reason for it, but the party did not ask any follow up questions to explore this new area of interest.

The party decided to go through the "present day" house one last time to see if there were any items that they did not originally encounter. The party found a lot of objects (listed above).
