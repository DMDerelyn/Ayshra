## Other notes:

The party decided to split for the night.

Connor and Edgar went to the nearest clearing to sleep close to nature. There, Connor gave Edgar a [[Data/Spells/PHB/Goodberry\|Goodberry]] to eat and went to sleep.

Tom, Kit, and Heartworm made their way to the [[Fightin' Hourglass\|Fightin' Hourglass]], which is a two-story red-brick building with a green-tiled roof. The symbol of the establishment is a fist wielding a broken hourglass. The interior of the bar was plain, but crowded with working class patrons. To the right of the entrance was a small clearing where a band was playing music for patrons seated at various sized tables. Straight ahead of the entrance was a stairwell going up to the rooms above, and a guarded stairwell going down to the cellar. To the left was the bar and entrance to the kitchens behind the bar.

There, the three took up different positions around the tavern: Tom took a seat at the end of the bar closest to the entrance; Heartworm took a seat at the other end of the bar, closes to the cellar stairwell; Kit took a seat at a table to the right where a patron had passed out drunk at a table by himself.

Kit searched the passed out elf, and found a note in elvish with tear stains on it, a woman's wedding band with elvish engraving on it, an engagement ring, and ten silver. Kit also found the key to Room No. 3.

Tom continued to loudly proclaim that he was rich and had lots of goods that he was taking  to a different part of town by land. The group noticed two people sets of people who were acting suspiciously. Tom paid for food and a room, totaling 2s & 1c. He received the key for Room No. 2. 

The first was a pair of dwarves, who Heartworm attempted to speak with directly about getting into the black market. They were hesitant and untrusting of his direct approach out in the open. 

The second was an unassuming male human, who the group later found out was name [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]]. He is a small, wiry man with dirty clothes and a ragged beard. Tom went to his room to lure [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]], which worked. Kit observed that he had a key that looked like a room key, but was unable to see the number.

Upon [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]] going upstairs, Heartworm followed. Tom put himself in the room and prepared a charmed person spell. Heartworm observed [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]] fumbling to pick Tom's lock, but once he did Heartworm charged at [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]], but stopped when Tom called him "friend" upon entering his room. [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]] was charmed, and Tom convinced [[Ayshra/NPCs/Musa Wolfwatcher\|Musa]] to run away before the police came, and quickly realizing his spell would have lasted much longer than originally anticipated.

Meanwhile, Madame Kit was talking to two dwarves, pretending to be with passed out elf. We left off with her trying to gain their trust to get more information about the black market and any illegal dealings.
