## Other notes:

Spoke with [[Ayshra/NPCs/Dead-eye Nix\|Dead-eye Nix]] about three quests ([[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Main Story Line\|Main Story Line]]). They chose to go after the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]], who is located to the Northeast of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]].

[[Players/Patrick\|Patrick]] decided to wildshape and run part of the way in horse form, avoiding any exhaustion penalty. It took approximately 6 hours. 

Arriving at [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]] at 6:00 PM, drew the attention of the local deputies because [[Players/Nick\|Nick]] created an illusion of a large money bag, and [[Players/David\|David]] created a second one. [[Players/Nick\|Nick]] then shouted that he stole that money from his wealthy master.

[[Players/Rie\|Rie]] dissuaded [[Inbox/Sheriff's Deputy Geoff\|Sheriff's Deputy Geoff]] from taking any further action, and they lead them to the local Sheriff's office.
