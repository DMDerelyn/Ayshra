## Other notes:

The party made its way through the house to the master's chambers after fighting a slime monster. After a thorough search, they found multiple letters and notes from Darius Corvius, the master of the house. In those letters, the party learned about Bysilla Corvius, the daughter of the master of the house, Darius Corvius. She has another sister, and a brother.  Their names remain unknown. 

They learned that there was some sort of illness that Darius couldn't figure out or cure. It drove him mad, and disinherited his son. The house fell to ruin upon his death, leaving it in the state they currently find the house -- decrepit and run down.

The party continued to explore and made their way upstairs, where they began an encounter with a Shard Stalker. Tom was able to remember stories from his people about the dangers of the Shard Stalker.

The Shard Stalker appears to be a doppelganger in many ways, but it is substantially different, and in many ways much worse. It does not want power, or to assimilate itself into the world, it wants to destroy the living. It has the innate ability to travel in and out of the mirrors of the manor.
