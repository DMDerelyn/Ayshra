## Other notes:

The party fought the dancing party, but part way through the battle Edgar mimicked the song that they were able to hear after the Waltergeist screamed. That caused all ghosts to stop attacking. Connor and Tom to join in, causing the ghosts to be fully placated.

The waltergeist, named Guthrie, showed the glimpses of the past and brought them into the main dining hall. There, the party discovered a tear-like portal. They step through and find themselves in a fully restored mansion. There, Kyrn, the son of Darius Corvius, stood by the fireplace. The party stepped out of the fireplace and began trying to deceive him.

He grew upset and cast [[Data/Spells/PHB/Time Stop\|Time Stop]], and cast [[Data/Spells/PHB/Power Word Stun\|Power Word Stun]] on Heartworm. He let go of the spells once the party mentioned teleportation, and their supposed masters Arnault D'antaneon. Kyrn attempted to convince the party that they should tell him their teleportation secret magic.

When the party was firm on not sharing the information with him, he escorted them to a bedroom. He gave Tom a pendant that gave him access to the house as a servant.
