## Locations Visited:

## NPCs involved:
- [[Guthrie\|Guthrie]]

## Other notes:

The party investigated the nature of the time portal, finding that the decrepit house and the past house seem to run on the same timeline. They were able to speak with ghost Guthrie, giving him a codeword (Pede) and gaining information from the present to bring to the past in order to convince past Guthrie to help them speak with the master of the house.

He answered a handful of questions about Darius, but most of the information he provided you already knew from the notes and letters you found. 

The party began preparing to speak with Darius and reviewed their strategy.
