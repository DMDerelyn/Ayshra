## Other notes:

We began with Kit attempting to get more information from the two dwarves. She found that they were in good clothing that were made to look worn, and had hands that were not workers' hands as their clothing might suggest. Giving up on this pursuit, the party retired for the night.

Connor sought information from the wildlife that surrounds the area, trying to find larger beasts. He was told of a Chimera, but zoned out afterwards and did not hear the remainder of the beasts. He then went to sleep.

The entire party long rested.

Edgar and Connor woke to a Tiefling sleeping nearby. After a little bit of trouble waking them, they learned that he was an escaped slave. He wished to escape to the north to be with the natives and learn the ways of the druids. Connor gave Edgar another [[Data/Spells/PHB/Goodberry\|Goodberry]], expecting Edgar to eat it; however, Edgar gave it to the recently freed slave named [[Ayshra/NPCs/Shi Northbound\|Shi Northbound]].  Edgar also gave Shi his amulet and gave him directions to go to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Staley Farms\|Staley Farms]] and visit the final stop of the underground railroad. 

After, the group met up and came up with a plan. Tom would go to Sherriff [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]], ask if he could borrow a carriage and some valuable items to be bait for the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]]. She agreed, handing him a piece of paper to retrieve what he needed from the town's evidence lock-up building.

The group made its way to the evidence lock-up building, looking out for any people following them. Because it was early in the morning and there was a pretty strong police presence in the area, they did not notice anyone. The evidence lock up building is a two-story, brick building. There are no windows on the main floor, and on the second floor, there are only slited windows, making it a highly definsible building. It has an archway going through the middle of the building big enough for carriage. Down this open "hall" there are doors on either side.

Tom handed over this note to [[Ayshra/NPCs/Landon Angeart\|Landon Angeart]], who seemed like an idealistic police officer who was eager to pay his dues and earn his way into field work. As he walked down the "hall" to his destination, Tom was able to look into a few as he passed them, and saw that there were people loading in very valuable items into boxes, marking the boxes, and taking notes in what appeared to be a room-specific item manifest. Each box was organized either by writing or a branding.



In the middle of the building, there were two larger doors perpendicular to the open hall Tom was walking down. The door to Tom's left was closed, and the door to the right was partially opened and guarded by additional police. The room had wooden boxes (presumably filled with valuables) stacked almost all the way up to the second-story roof.

Tom discerned that he didn't think the neighborhood was big enough to support a police force of this size. Just this morning, he had seen at least a dozen officers connected solely with the evidence lock-up building. Also, noticeable to Tom was that the goods held here were extremely valuable.

Tom took items totaling well over a thousand gold pieces. Landon wrote down each item Tom took, intending to mark it down in the manifest, making two duplicate copies for the master manifest in the building, and one for Sheriff [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]]. Tom was not able to persuade him to hand over the notes.

Tom loaded up the carriage (and hitched the horses) to make his way out of the neighborhood past the borders of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]]. There, they went just beyond a cluster of trees to hide the fact that the party loaded up into the carriage. Connor planned on transforming into a rat or other small animal and follow along, but did not inform the group of his intentions.
