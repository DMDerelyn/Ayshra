## Other notes:

With their stolen carriage and goods, the party made their way around [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]], into the woods, and back on to the main road. They traveled to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]], where they quickly found an art dealer by the name of Tom.

There, they discovered some high-priced art pieces, as well as some information about who buys high priced art. The group discovered three names of citizens who purchase expensive art from [[Tom, the Art Dealer\|Tom, the Art Dealer]]. Their names are Fahira, Theda, Ogden.

They were able to each earn 1,530g per character after the sale of all the non-magical items they had stolen from [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]]'s evidence lockup. The money was given to them by a notarized, magical "check" which they deposited in the local non-union bank. 

Upon opening an account, each player received magical money purses to give them direct access to their gold that was stored in the bank.
