## Other notes:

The party decided to deceive [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]] about the non-magical items being lost in a fire. 

They told her that they got into a fight with the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]], but the goods were lost in a fire in the process. At first, it seemed like she believed the group. She lead them through the evidence storage building, tearing up a copy of the manifest contained the items that the party lost.

Emry then lead the group underneath the evidence lockup. There, the party found dirty, small cells filled with women and children. She lead them to another locked room, dismissed a guard who was present, and then tore out the final page that contained the items that the party lost.

She confronted the group, saying she didn't care that they probably stole those items. So long as they didn't fence them in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]], she wouldn't pursue them. She clarified that they were welcome in her neighborhood, so long as they continued to be useful and didn't cause trouble.

The party left, debated helping the women and children, but ultimately decided to make their way to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]].
