## Other notes:

The party went shopping, purchasing multiple magical and non-magical items. 

After their shopping, they visited a Teamster's Union friendly bar, the Hungry Respite. It was relativelty empty, but the party did speak to and gain a lot of information about the Teamster's Union from this member.

The current head of the Teamster's Union is named Lorcan. The manager of the Civil Center's chapter of the Teamster's Union is named Randal, who went missing within the past week around the time that the mysterious work slips were handed out, forcing every member of the Teamster's Union to work on election day. Lastly, Gerbold is the name of the candidate running against the current head of the Teamster's Union in this election.

The current election involves electing all the heads of the various unions, who also serve as legislature for [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay \|Clay]]. The Governor as well as mayor of Clay are also up for re-election. 

There are 8 days until election day. 

The party decided to investigate Randal's house, the Civil Center chapter's manager for the Teamster's Union. They found his house, broke in, and discovered one of the back rooms was ransacked.
