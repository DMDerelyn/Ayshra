## Other notes:

The party began by speaking with [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]], the Sherrif of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]]. They found her in the Sherriff's office, polishing a handgun. The party was able to find out the following information from her:

1. The Halfspears were robbed by the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]] about one month prior.
2. [[Ayshra/NPCs/Morgan Lightboot\|Morgan Lightboot]] is the cousin of [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]]
3. She is friendly with [[Hylass Swordbane\|Hylass Swordbane]], the Owner of the [[Fightin' Hourglass\|Fightin' Hourglass]], an inexpensive Tavern/Inn.
4. There are three other Taverns/Inns in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]]: [[The Forgotten Foot\|The Forgotten Foot]] (middle class), [[The Giant Glass\|The Giant Glass]] (teamster's hangout), and [[The Burnt Drum\|The Burnt Drum]] (upper class).

[[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]] provided the group with an additional bounty for the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]]: 2g if they killed him, bringing back his ring still attached to his finger; 5g for him alive.

After visiting the Halfspears (a well-educated, Tiefling couple), you discovered that they were robbed when they were moving into the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region by land. They intended to set up a weapon shop, and were working with local manufacturing companies and tradespeople to establish a local supplychain to keep costs low for their wares. They lost almost all of their wealth, except for the money that they had stored in the banks, which allows them to survive--albeit at a lower standard than they were expecting.

They indicated that they had spoken with [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]], the yet unnamed Sherriff of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Staley Farms\|Staley Farms]], weaponsmiths from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Smithmille\|Smithmille]] and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Neighborhoods/Armourdale\|Armourdale]], a representative from the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]], and other officials who might have been able to help them settle into the region. 

The party visited [[Ayshra/NPCs/Morgan Lightboot\|Morgan Lightboot]], who told them similar information to the Halfspears. After a successful insight check into Morgan, Tom realized that he was hiding something. It turned out that [[Ayshra/NPCs/Morgan Lightboot\|Morgan Lightboot]] didn't think everything added up because he wasn't sure how a one legged, old man could be a threat to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]]. He mentioned there were at least six family members (grandchildren or neices/nephews) who were part of the gang.

Their names are:
- Karic Lightboot
- Clive Lightboot
- Elaina Lightboot
- Orthia Lightboot
- Raul Lightboot
- Mason Lightboot
