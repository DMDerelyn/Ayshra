## Other notes:

The party made its way through the northern hills of the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region, finding the [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]]'s home in the middle of a plateau. The house looked similar to the note that was given to the group by [[Ayshra/NPCs/Dead-eye Nix\|Dead-eye Nix]] at the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Landmarks/Casino Queen\|Casino Queen]]. It had crop fields, a barn, and a dirt road leading up to it. 

Tom took the carriage past the barn, hearing at least two people working on the inside, but Tom could not see anyone else as he made his way to the house. Tom continued his ruse to be a rich man passing through, telling [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]] that he was lost that he required assistance.

To Tom's surprise, [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]] was kind and gave him a lot of information about his background. 

Many followers of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Gods/Torm\|Torm]] who were driven from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]] in 1833 found refuge in Clay for at least a short time. The violence that brought the followers of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Gods/Torm\|Torm]] to the settlement of Clay drove them out once more. Their failure to incorporate themselves into the everyday traditions of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]] stemmed from their belief that they needed to ascend by making themselves more Warforged by replacing body parts. 

After an encounter that left two dead, they swiftly banned the worship of Torm, as well as the painting of any face of a God. Those who had modified their bodies were banned from the city limits and their property was forfeit. [[Ayshra/Campaign 01/Quests/Black Hand Killer\|Black Hand Killer]] told Tom that his daughter was murdered, and he sought revenge and killed his daughter's killer, gaining his name when someone witnessed his hand covered in his daughter's killer's blood.

He also let Tom know that his name is Bill. Although unsaid, his last name is Lightboot based on previous people that the group has spoken to. 

Bill happily cut off his ring finger, replacing it with a warforged finger to satisfy [[Ayshra/NPCs/Emry Duskdancer\|Emry Duskdancer]]'s request. He asked the party that if they found themselves in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]], they attempt to break out his religious leaders out of the local jail before their trial.
