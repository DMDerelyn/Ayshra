## Other notes:

The party decided to continue their investigation of Randal's house, the Civil Center chapter's manager for the Teamster's Union. They had previously found his house, broke in, and discovered one of the back rooms was ransacked.

Upon a foray into the kitchen and other back rooms, the party discovered two human-like children (female) staring at three doll houses. Upon a quick investigation, they angered the two girls, and found themselves in front of one of the doll houses. Its appearance dramatically changed to a run-down, decaying house.

The party went inside, but Connor decided to try peace negotiations with the now giant girls. He conjured a flower, and touched the hand that attempted to smash the party. Upon touching the hand, it revealed red skin and halved Connor's health.

The party found shelter in the dollhouse, and began exploring. They made their way to the second floor, upon which they found a throne room filled with monsters and ghosts.

Throughout the house, a crest has been visible. It contains a serpent, tied in a knot in the middle of its body with venom dripping from its teeth. The party fought their way into what appears to be a perfectly preserved (if not dusty) master bedroom.
