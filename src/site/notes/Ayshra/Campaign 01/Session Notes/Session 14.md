## Other notes:

Tom explored the library of the mansion. He spoke with a librarian Imp. With the help of Edgar's forgery, Tom was able to procure all the books he needed to learn about the gems, teleportation circle, and a little bit more about their circumstances.

They learned that it was currently 1762, 100 years prior to the time in Clay prior to entering the dollhouse. 

The more perfect and clear the gem, the higher level spell slot it can store. It is used to empower the teleportation circle, and the optimal number for the gems is an equivalent of one eighth level spell. 

They were able to find a book with all the power words to travel to specific locations. 

The group retired. Before taking a long rest, they empowered the gem with two three level spells, which with the second level spell already present in it, got the gem to the requisite level eight. 

Tom enchanted a bolt with a glyph of warding.
