## Other notes:

After fleeing the Shard Stalker, the group began covering mirrors throughout the house. With that out of the way, the party found a teleportation circle. They noticed that the teleportation needs 6 gems, bone ash, and a power word for it to function again. 

Through more notes they find in their search throughout the house, they discover the name of the second daughter of Darius Corvius: Elseth Corvius. They discovered her name when they found a necklace with a gem that the group recognized would work with the teleporter somehow.

Now on the search for the remaining five gems and any additional information on how to work the teleportation circle, the party has a newfound means of escape.
