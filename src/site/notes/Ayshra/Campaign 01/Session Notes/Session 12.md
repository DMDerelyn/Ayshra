## Other notes:

Last session, the party continued to explore the haunted dollhouse.

They found a ballroom with multiple dancing partners, and a single ghost off to the side. The lone ghost screamed, allowing the group to hear the music that the dancing partners were dancing to. 

Edgar immediately started blasting, which started a battle between ghost and the party. After a few rounds of combat, Edgar used his Kenku mimicry to copy the sounds of the song being danced to, pacifying the ghosts. Connor and Tom joined in, completely pacifying them and allowing you to communicate with the ghosts.

The lone ghost explained that if you were invited to the house, the shard stalker would not attack them anymore. However, he did not have the power to invite you to the house. Only the master of the manor did -- Darius Corvius, his two daughters Elseth and Bysilla, or his yet unnamed son.

Once communicating, you were shown glimpses of the past. He led you to the main dining hall, where you saw a tear between two realms. The manner of the tear leads you to believe that something went wrong, and there was a massive explosion that killed multiple devils, potentially setting off the course of events that made the house the way it is now.
