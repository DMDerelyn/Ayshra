# Black Hand Killer

## Giver:
[[Ayshra/NPCs/Dead-eye Nix\|Dead-eye Nix]]

## Start:
> Famous Black Hand Killer has earned himself a fortune from highway robbery and train robbing. He's used his earnings to buy himself a plot of land just to the north, outside the reach of the law. 

> The sheriff has reached out, asking you to be the invisible hand of the land to take care of this menace and his gang. You'd be welcome to take any of Black Hand's spoils, and the Sheriff would be able to take the heat off each person who helped him once. Since they are outside her jurisdiction, she can't offer any silver as a reward, but can put in a good word for you if you find yourself on the wrong side of the law.
