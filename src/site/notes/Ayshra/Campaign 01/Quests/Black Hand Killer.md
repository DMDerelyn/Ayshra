## Start:

[[Ayshra/NPCs/Dead-eye Nix\|Dead-eye Nix]] is the owner and proprietor of the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Landmarks/Casino Queen\|Casino Queen]]. He earned his named because of his distinctive milky left eye and for his tendency to feed his enemies to the fishes. Despite his reputation, he takes in orphans, the disabled, vagabonds, and former slaves to work for his organization. He provides a kinder life to them than the plains of Trigentes would.

His success requires the people of Clay to feel safe, be prosperous, and have a place to turn when the lawman fails them. Anyone who threatens the prosperity of Clay faces his wrath. To that end, he receives letters from some locals on a nearly daily basis, asking for him to employ some of his discrete contacts to take care of a few problems without involving the law. Today is much like any other day, except her most recent group of contacts never returned. He calls on his strongest, most reliable contacts, and asks them to come in to help around town while he tries to find out what happened to his last crew.

His across all of Trigentes gave him five names (If you describe your character's appearance once I state their name. If there's anything other players should know, please include that):

His contacts with the local freemen in Clay gave him the name of Tom Freeman

His contacts with some veterans around town gave him the name of Heartworm.

The natives put forth one name: Connor Quiet-Feather 

His contact with the [[Red Legs\|Red Legs]] gave him the name of: Edgar Allen Crow

Lastly, one of his more trusted employees who is known to keep the peace, Madame Kit Lucinda.

A worker from the local teamster's union said that he and his entire team got slips sayin the boss scheduled them on voting day. He asked around and everyone he knew in the union got the same note. There ain't ever that much work, even during harvest. Something's fishy. 

Your union man wants you to investigate, and offered his team's wages for a day, totaling 17.5g. (25 people per team). He knows you have friends who aren't terribly friendly with the teamster's union, so he would throw in some extra info as a way to sweeten the pot, so to speak.

Widow Aberdeen inherited a silver mine to the north of Briarcliff Bluffs. The local snake oil salesman has been hounding her for her hand in marriage. She has no interest. She's also had some of the local teamsters (not actually teamsters) come and threaten her if she don't hand over that deed to the mine. That snake oil salesman promised to keep her safe if she married him, but she just don't know. As a sign of his good will, he called his cousin in from out of town who took up guard at the silver mine. 

The folks who have been bothering her haven't been heard from again, and she is worried she might be on the wrong side of the law now. 

She is asking you to investigate discreetly, and if you find out what is going on and make sure she stays on the right side of the law. She'll reward you with 10g (in silver) for that, and if you can scare off the snake oil salesman without landing her on the wrong side of the law, she'll throw in an extra 5g (in silver).

Famous Black Hand Killer has earned himself a fortune from highway robbery and train robbing. He's used his earnings to buy himself a plot of land just to the north, outside the reach of the law. 

The sheriff has reached out, asking you to be the invisible hand of the land to take care of this menace and his gang. You'd be welcome to take any of Black Hand's spoils, and the Sheriff would be able to take the heat off each person who helped him once. Since they are outside her jurisdiction, she can't offer any silver as a reward, but can put in a good word for you if you find yourself on the wrong side of the law.
