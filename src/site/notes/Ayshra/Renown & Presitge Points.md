### Renown Points:

Renown points can be gained through completing tasks/quests or through downtime activities.

### Prestige Points:

Prestige points are gained 1:1 with renown points, and can be spent on special benefits. Benefits from lower renown rankings can be used at higher renown levels.

#### Renown 1:

1PP: Once per day, you can gain advantage on a single investigation check that involves the faction.

2PP: During downtime activities, the characters can hire a skilled worker within the faction to assist in crafting a non-magical item or consumable magic item (potion, scroll, etc.). The cost of crafting the item is reduced by 4d6%, and the time required to craft the item is reduced by half.

3PP: During downtime activities, the characters may use a member of the faction to overcome a unwanted complication. Depending on the nature of the complication may required 1d4 x 5gp to overcome safely. 

#### Renown 2:

2PP: Faction lower-class housing is available to you for free for one week. If a character uses this option for more than two weeks in a row, they will suffer -1 RP and the cost of staying in the house doubles. Characters still must pay for their own food, but at a 4d6% decrease in price.

3PP: Characters may use the faction's merchants to sell their items at an increased price of 10% except for items sold at full value (gems, trade goods, etc.). If the character has the proper components and the faction has a skilled crafter, the player may sell the raw materials on consignment for 40% of the crafted item. It will take (total cost/5g) days to craft with an additional  days to sell, depending on cost of item. You can decrease the time it takes to craft by employing additional tradesmen, but your percentage will decrease by 10 for each additional tradesman.

4PP: Once per month, if a character finds themselves in jail awaiting trial, they may call upon a connected member of their faction to grease the wheels of justice to reduce the sentence to a fine only in exchange for a plea of guilty.  If the character wishes to try to get the charges dismissed completely, they may roll a d20 with varying levels for the seriousness of the crime: DC10 for misdemeanor; DC15 for class E & D felonies; DC20 for class C & B felonies; DC 25 for class A felonies. If there is no fine associated with the class felony, then only the second option may be employed.

#### Renown 3:

3PP: The characters may call on an expert investigator, scholar, librarian, or other knowledgeable member of the faction to answer a single question. If the question can be answered, it will be done at a minimum of 8 hours.

4PP: Faction middle-class accomodation for the price of lower class accomodations for one week.  If a character uses this option for more than two weeks in a row, they will suffer -1 RP and the cost of staying in the house doubles. Characters still must pay for their own food, but at a 4d6% decrease in price.

5PP: Once per month, if a character finds themselves in jail awaiting trial, they may call upon a connected member of their faction to be an alibi witness, absolving you of all wrongdoing. You may use this without penalty twice, and any additional times after cost an additional 1d4 PP and 1d4 RP. If you drop renown level as a result of using this, it automatically fails.

#### Renown 4:

4PP: You gain the title of Officer, giving you the ability to call on low-ranking members to perform mundane tasks including sending messages, making preparations, arranging accomodations, and similarly mundane tasks. You also gain a +2 intimidation check against any rival faction member. You may not have this title in two rival factions.

5PP: Faction upper-class housing is available to you for the price of middle-class accomodations for one week. If a character uses this option for more than two weeks in a row, they will suffer -1 RP and the cost of staying in the house doubles. Characters still must pay for their own food, but at a 4d6% decrease in price.

6PP: The characters may use their repuatation and influence to schedule a private audience with any individual within the city of influence that the faction resides. The character gains +2 on a single conversation-related check while speaking with that individual. If multiple characters are present for this private audience, only the character who scheduled the meeting gains the bonus. Multiple characters cannot schedule simultaneous meetings with the individual to have this bonus to stack.

#### Renown 5: 

5PP: The characters can buy non-magical items or magical consumables at-cost. 

6PP: Once, the characters can receive a wondrous item that is closely associated with the faction's purpose.

10PP: One character may put their names in the running to ascend to be the second-in-command for the given faction. Depending on the faction, they must either be elected, appointed, or complete a task/quest/trial. Perks of being second-in-command include unfettered access to the faction's base. This character cannot bring unapproved guests, but does have influence on who can and cannot be approved for access.  The character can call on an expert investigator, scholar, librarian, or other knowledgeable member of the faction to answer a single question without spending any Prestige Points. The character can stay in any level accomodation for free, and not pay for food. The character gains a modest income of 5s/day.

Picking this option causes the character to lose all titles with other factions, but has no impact on the reputation with other friendly factions. The character's status with rival factions will automaticaly drop to Hated unless at Hunted, in which case it will remain at Hunted. If the character goes against the aims and goals of the faction, they can be removed, and will have their Renown points reduced by 5.
