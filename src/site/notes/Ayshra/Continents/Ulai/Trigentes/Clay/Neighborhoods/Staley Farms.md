# Staley Farms
![Staley Farms.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Staley%20Farms.png)
## Visual Description:

Staley Farms is a small location that has been cannibalized by the surrounding areas of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Briarcliff Bluffs\|Briarcliff Bluffs]], [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/River Quay\|River Quay]], and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]]. 

Locals complain about the noise, which is minimal compared to the surrounding areas, but is still greater than the near absolute silence that they have been accustomed to.

## Location:
	Settlement: Clay
	Area of Settlement: North East
	Zoned for: industry

## History:

At the founding [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]] consisted of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]] and Staley Farms. It is now slowly being converted into a "historic district" - greatly opposed by the local farmhands and ranchers. 

It once used to be able to sustain the entire population of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]], but now is whittled down to only being able to provide select upscale restaurants and limited tradespeople with produce and animal products. 

Promises, offers, bribes, and threats have all been employed to take ownership of this land, but none have succeeded so far.
