## Visual Description:

North Bottoms is the industrial hub of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]], where the only inter-state cargo train station in the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region lives. Residential buildings conform to the Priarie School style, and the industrial/commercial buildings follow the Sullivanesque style. 

This area is considered medium density. 

## Location:
	Settlement: Clay
	Area of Settlement: South East

## History:

Before the war, there was a bridge that was being built to connect [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]] with [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]], but the construction has since stopped. 

While the transport of goods from the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]] to any non-slave holding state is strictly illegal, the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]] has secretly stepped in to settle some needs of the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]]. This was done in part as a money-making opportunity, but was also done to prevent a second battle of the markets, where over 100 people were killed and hundreds were wounded on each side to take over different trade markets and ports.
