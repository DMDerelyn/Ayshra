Smithmille is named after the two industries founded here (Smithing and Milling), it sits to the south west of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/Civil Center\|Civil Center]], with a large, wide road connecting the two.

Smithville, going against the rest of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]] have cooperated with the indigenous people in order to maintain the continuous growth of the trees and surrounding nature. In exchange, the indigenous druids have assisted in extracting metals from the ground without disturbing the land.
