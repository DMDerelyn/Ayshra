# River Quay
![River Quay.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/River%20Quay.png)
## Visual Description:

The [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Cobalt River\|Cobalt River]] splits off to an inlet at the beginning of the eastern bend. The settlers built quays to make the docks closer to the markets at the edge of the river bed. Here, almost all the imports by river are docked and processed here. River Quay is barely organized chaos, as teamsters, hawkers, and everyone between make their way to buy, sell, and trade goods here. 

Many of the smaller settlements to the west use river boats to transport goods here, where they are then processed, divided, and carried to the train for further transport to the east. 

At the mouth of the two rivers, the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Landmarks/Casino Queen\|Casino Queen]] (named as an insult to the Queen of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]]) lives. 

## Location:
	Settlement: Clay
	Area of Settlement: South West
	Zoned for: commercial/industry

## History:

River Quay is the first and only major water port in the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region. Before trains made their way to this area, it was the only way to transport goods to any nation here or other settlements to the west.

When the nations to the east proposed to pay for a cargo train station/terminal, the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]] organized to prevent them from making a connection directly to the west. As part of this organization, the [[[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]] government invested into its infrastructure to make it the most convenient and safest mode of transportation west for settlers looking to travel beyond the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region. 

Now, any person or nation who wants to ship to or from the west must hire the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]] to transport the goods from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Neighborhoods/North Bottoms\|North Bottoms]] to River Quay, or pay a levy as it passes through [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] on the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Cobalt River\|Cobalt River]].
