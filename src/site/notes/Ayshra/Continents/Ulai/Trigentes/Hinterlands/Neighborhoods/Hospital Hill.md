# Hospital Hill
![Hospital Hill.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Hospital%20Hill.png)
## Visual Description:
The two hospitals are actually a part of the same guilding. It has a central tower rising in an upward cascade of almost-white masonry, including Gothic arches patterned brickwork soaring upwards of 350 feet high. Twelve smaller buildings bloom outwards from the center tower, creating a sharp-edged flower pattern in honor of The Crown. The top floor of each building is used as temporary housing for doctors and nurses who have overnight shifts.

Nine foot gothic arches mark the entrance, where flower-themed mosiacs can be found in the floors and stained-glass windows. 

## Location:

## History:

Named for the multiple hospitals on the hill to the south of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]] and north of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Country Club Plaza\|Country Club Plaza]]. One hospital is [[Children's Mercy\|Children's Mercy]], the other is [[Two Rivers Regional Medical Center\|Two Rivers Regional Medical Center]]. 

Here, whomever seeks aid from either hospital will receive free medical attention. All employees of the hospitals receive free housing and meals from the Crown. This housing is made in the same style as the hospital, but the white stone is reserved for the hospital buildings. Instead, the housing are made with more common, natural colored stones and wood. 

Because of the large amount of employees that it takes to run and maintain the hospitals, the neighborhood of Hospital Hill has a significant commercial presence to the east of the hospitals. Most residents of this neighborhood are [[Royalists\|Royalists]]. Because of the proximity of the hospitals, punishment for any violence in this neighborhood is enhanced and doubled.

The land is owned by the Crown and leased to the hospitals, businesses, and surrounding non-staff housing.
