## Location:

	Area of Settlement: South
	Zoned for: residential/commercial

## History:

The Country Club Plaza serves as a commercial outlet for the southern portions of the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]]. It mainly serves [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Ward Heights\|Ward Heights]] and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Blue Valley Farms\|Blue Valley Farms]], while also providing an outlet for the local golf course [[Hinterlands Country Club\|Hinterlands Country Club]], it's partial namesake.

It diverges from downtown's aesthetic for two key reasons: first, the majority of the citizens housed here and to the south are [[Nationalists\|Nationalists]]; second, the diverging aesthetic attempts to portray this area as a new, non-noble upper-class that was not present at the founding of the city-state. 

Most facilities are not open to the public and either require a specific membership or proof of landholding title in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Country Club Plaza\|Country Club Plaza]], [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Ward Heights\|Ward Heights]], or [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Blue Valley Farms\|Blue Valley Farms]]. 

As a partially independent part of the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]], they do not have to obey all decrees of the Crown.
