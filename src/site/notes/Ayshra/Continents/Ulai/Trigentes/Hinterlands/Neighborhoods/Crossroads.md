# Crossroads
![Crossroads.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Crossroads.png)
## Visual Description:

Crossroads is a working class housing neighborhood. Consisting of shorter, blockier and utilitarian apartment buildings, this neighborhood's aesthetics are stark compared to the extravagant [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]]and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Country Club Plaza\|Country Club Plaza]]. 

Red and gray brick buildings line the streets, wall-to-wall. There are wide sidewalks with streetcars that run down the middle of the cobblestone street, branching out in all directions to take the worker to their place of employment. There are very few trees in the neighborhood, but those that remain are large and ancient looking, spreading wide canopies over small parks and the occaisional building.

## History:

Founded out of necessity for housing all the workers required to support the surrounding areas, it grew to include small corner shops, mom-and-pop restaurants, loan, and repair shops. 

Most residents here work in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]], [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Country Club Plaza\|Country Club Plaza]], [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Westport\|Westport]], or [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/West Bottoms\|West Bottoms]]; only a minority of the residents who live here are members of a union. The residents here are lower class, where the unions have begun to create and grow a middle class.
