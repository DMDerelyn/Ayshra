## History:

Independence was once the seat of power in the Hinterlands. Within the first year of being built, it was burned down. There are some who believe it was the Druids, there are others who believe it was one or all of the Unions. No one was ever apprehended.

For safety, The Crown decided to move out from the center of town and establish its own district, separate from the citizens. That became [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]], and much of the non-farming and non-ranching industry left with the Crown. 

Since the departure, they have attempted to court the unions.
