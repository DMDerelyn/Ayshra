# West Bottoms
![West Bottoms.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/West%20Bottoms.png)
## Visual Description:

Red brick warehouses loom over the farmer's market tents that sit next to dirt-covered brick roads. Unlike other markets, this one is oddly quiet. The nobility's "help" crowd the street with their carts filled with fresh produce and animal products. They quickly go in and out of shops with hand-written lists while the shop keeps dart around, grabbing what is on the list for them. No physical coin is exchanged, only paper. 

## Location:
	Settlement: Hinterlands
	Area of Settlement: North West
	Zoned for: commercial

## History:

West Bottoms started as some of the early farmlands owned by the Druids to the North. Soon after the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/East Bottoms\|East Bottoms]] was bought by the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]], the [[Woodworker's Union\|Woodworker's Union]] and the [[Textile Union\|Textile Union]] jointly purchased the West bottoms to develop a trading district closer to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]]. 

Upon purchase, the land was quickly transformed into a textile, woodworking, butcher, and farmer market for the general public to walk to from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]].  The Corwn gave the unions a choice to either pay additional taxes for police and fire protection, or it would allow the unions to establish their own. The [[Woodworker's Union\|Woodworker's Union]] and the [[Textile Union\|Textile Union]]  chose their own, and brought in the [[Farmer's Union\|Farmer's Union]], the [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]], and the [[Rancher's Union\|Rancher's Union]] to have control of this area of town.

The unions are considering setting up a sports arena to draw more people in.
