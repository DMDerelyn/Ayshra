## History:

East Bottoms was once early farmlands that belonged to the druids in the north. The farms were quickly purchased by [[Teamster's Union\|Teamster's Union]] to set up a presence in the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]]. From their purchase, the East Bottoms have transformed into one of the most densely-packed industrial areas in the City. 

There are a variety of goods sold here, but the majority are livestock, animal products, and wheat. There is currently a bridge for the cargo train to pass over the river for more efficient transportation of goods.
