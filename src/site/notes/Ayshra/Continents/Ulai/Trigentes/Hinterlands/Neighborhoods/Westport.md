# Westport
![Westport.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Westport.png)
## Visual Description:

Westport is an oddly empty part of town, with the exception of its main street, which is where there are wall-to-wall buildings leading from the more populous part of town. This is due to the multiple incursions by [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]].

There are wide open spaces that are used for markets, faires, and other large-scale activities. Roads are slightly wider to accomodate more caravans, but all of the buildings are smaller one or two-story warehouse style buildings. There is an occaisional tavern, inn, and eatery to accomodate the workers; however, they are all lower quality to keepc osts down to serve those coming in and out of Westport.

## History:

Westport sits on the Western border, south of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]]. Here, the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]] trade with [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]] by land. All trade from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]] goes through Westport and travels by short-distance rail to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]], where the main inter-city-state rail is located. 

[[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Westport\|Westport]] was the hotbed for most of the illegal slave escape routes to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], where slavery was (and still is) illegal.
