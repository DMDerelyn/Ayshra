River market sits to the north of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]] and in-between [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/East Bottoms\|East Bottoms]] and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/West Bottoms\|West Bottoms]]. The river market serves [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Crown Center\|Crown Center]] for its commercial needs, including restaurants, pubs, inns, and other non-farmed goods. 

These places of business are equipped with magical means to stay open all four seasons while maintaining a comfortable temperature and atmosphere both inside and outside. Local magical engineers have also deployed means to keep the river from flooding this area.
