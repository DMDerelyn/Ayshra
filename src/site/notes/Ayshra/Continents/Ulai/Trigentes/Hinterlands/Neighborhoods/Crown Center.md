## History:
After the original building in [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Independence\|Independence]] was burned during construction, the Crown decided to move west towards the border of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]] and [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]]. Here, they established royal quarters, and much of the civil service provided to the kingdom, including police, fire, health, [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Landmarks/The Queen's Kitchen\|The Queen's Kitchen]] and [[Crown Center Housing\|Crown Center Housing]].

The Crown also established other public amenities, most notably the [[Royal  Commons\|Royal  Commons]]. 

Shortly after the move was announced, most of the business and much of the residential that was being built up around [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Neighborhoods/Independence\|Independence]] was abanonded or moved to Crown Center. It currently serves as the seat of power to the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Hinterlands/Hinterlands\|Hinterlands]].

The Crown owns all of the land in Crown Center, and leases it out. The Crown's income comes from these leases, which are tax-exempt. Their abdication of power does not change their ownership of the land crucial for the City's functioning.

Most residents of this neighborhood are [[Royalists\|Royalists]].
