## Visual Description:

Overland Square is built up around a waterfall formed by a natural spring.  It is the center and seat of power of [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Clay/Clay\|Clay]], where most of the nation's activities take place. Its walkable, and often crowded. 

Many of the buildings here are inns and rest stops for the long journey west. 

## Location:
	Settlement: Stone
	Area of Settlement: Central
	Zoned for: residential/commercial/industry

## History:

Although most travelers use the river as a means of transportation west, there are a few locations close to [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]] that are not accessible by water travel, so Overland Square acts as one of the last settled areas before traveling into indigineous lands. 

Overland Square was established as a last ditch attempt to keep people from going west, or to keep their money from going west. In an effort to achieve that goal, the neighborhood is set up to allow caravans to pass through the streets, with ample opportunity to stop and rest. The neighborhood also uses the natural beautiy to enhance its welcoming atmosphere.

Overland Square is generally safe from native incursions.
