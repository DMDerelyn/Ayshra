![Armourdale.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Armourdale.png)
## Visual Description:

Armourdale is a desolate industrial area with smokestacks that touch the skies, and densely packed buildings with dirty roads and foul smelling water.  

## Location:
	Settlement: Stone
	Area of Settlement: North West
	Zoned for: industry

## History:

Armourdale draws the ire of the indigineous people, and is often the site of raids and battles. Its lack of respect for nature and polluting ways are an anathema to the druids of the plains. Unlike its surrounding neighborhoods, it does not use magical means of production to keep the area clean. Instead, it uses cheaper means of production, which use heavier pollutants.

The neighborhood was devestated by an early incursion, now named "[[The Red Flood\|The Red Flood]]" and there is a city holiday dedicated to the lives lost in the battle. 

More recently, the druids set fire to the lake it butts up to without the use of magical means. The water was simply just so toxic and flamable that they were able to accomplish it with a single torch in the dead of night. About ten people died from inhaling the toxic fumes from the flames.

Almost all residents of this neighborhood have a vitriolic hatred for natives.
