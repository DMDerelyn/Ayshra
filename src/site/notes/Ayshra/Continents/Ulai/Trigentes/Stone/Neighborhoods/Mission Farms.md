# Mission Farms
![Mission Farms.png](/img/user/Inbox/Attachments/Mission%20Farms.png)
## Visual Description:

At the center of the convergence of multiple farm fields, stands multiple stone archways and other natural, decorative objects around it. Each archway represents a different element found in nature. One stone archway has a waterfall that pours out of it into a a small pool at the base. It flows underground hundreds of feet to form a small creek at the bottom of a sheer, mossy clif face. 

This stands at the center of Mission Farms and is a druidic sacred ground that remains undisturbed as part of a tentative peace agreement.

## History:

Mission Hills is a ancient sacred ground for the indigineous druid tribes where they worship the gods of the elements. A peace treaty was signed between the different tribes where it was declared that any who are entering or leaving this sacred ground is granted safe passage for the remainder of their journey. To encourage and enforce this treaty, they would each bring elemental crystals to and from the site. Any person found to either fraudulently claim that they were coming to or from the sacred ground or to harm another coming to or from the sacred ground would be punished by death.

Upon the settlers from the east arriving, after some bloodshed around the sacred area, there was a similar treaty. All natives were guaranteed safe passage and allowed to worship freely, while the settlers were allowed to use the fertile ground around it to grow food for their people. The indigineous people took a tithing of ten percent of all food grown on these lands.
