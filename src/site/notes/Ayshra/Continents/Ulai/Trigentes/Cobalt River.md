# Cobalt River

## Location:
	Settlement: Trigentes
	Neighborhood: N/A

## Visual Description:



## History:

The Cobalt River was the quickest way to transport people and goods from the east to the west. In recent years, the expansion of the railway to the [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] region made the Cobalt river less desirable for transportation from the east to this region. However, it is still the dominant mode of transportation to get at least part of the way from [[Ayshra/Continents/Ulai/Trigentes/Trigentes\|Trigentes]] to the West Coast.
